POC Request: AI-Powered Summarization of
Unstructured Data
1. Overview
The objective of this Proof of Concept (POC) is to evaluate and implement an AI-driven solution that
can process large volumes of unstructured data and generate concise, accurate, and
business-relevant summaries. Currently, our teams receive information from multiple
heterogeneous sources in varying formats — including free-form text, tables without headers,
embedded images, copied snapshots, and other non-standard structures. Manually analyzing such
data is time-consuming, inconsistent, and prone to human error. This POC aims to automate the
extraction of meaningful insights and provide summarized information that can support faster and
more accurate decision-making.
2. Business Problem
Our organization regularly deals with unstructured data that requires contextual understanding to
derive business insights. Key challenges include: • Unstructured Inputs: Data exists in diverse
formats, such as images, tables without headers, free-text notes, and mixed content. • High Manual
Effort: Current processes require significant human intervention to parse, understand, and
summarize content. • Inconsistent Interpretations: Different teams interpret unstructured data
differently, leading to potential discrepancies. • Time Sensitivity: In critical scenarios, delays in
analyzing large data sets impact operational efficiency and decision timelines.
3. Objective of the POC
The goal is to assess the feasibility of using AI-based summarization models to: • Automatically
parse, process, and interpret unstructured data across multiple formats. • Identify key entities,
metrics, and contextual relationships without requiring predefined data schemas. • Generate
concise, accurate summaries tailored to specific business objectives. • Reduce manual
dependencies and improve response times in time-sensitive workflows.
4. Scope
The POC will focus on: • Parsing multi-format data sources (free-form text, tabular data including
incomplete or headerless tables, and embedded images). • Applying AI-driven techniques for text
extraction, normalization, entity identification, and summarization. • Delivering summarized outputs
aligned with stakeholder requirements.
5. Approach
1. Data Ingestion & Preprocessing: - Collect representative unstructured data samples. - Apply
preprocessing techniques such as OCR for images, parsing for tables, and cleaning for raw inputs.
2. Model Evaluation: - Evaluate traditional AI/ML models for NER, table parsing, and
summarization. - Compare approaches for accuracy, scalability, and performance. 3.
Summarization Framework: - Combine rule-based techniques with AI-driven models to extract key
entities and relationships, preserve context, and generate summaries. 4. Validation &
Benchmarking: - Define evaluation metrics such as precision, recall, summary accuracy, and time
savings. - Gather business stakeholder feedback to validate outcomes.
6. Expected Benefits
• Operational Efficiency: Significant reduction in manual analysis efforts. • Consistency & Accuracy:
Standardized interpretation across teams. • Faster Decision-Making: Summaries delivered in near
real-time. • Scalability: Ability to handle growing data volumes without increasing resource
requirements.
7. Deliverables
• Summarized Reports: AI-generated summaries of unstructured datasets. • POC Findings
Document: Detailing performance metrics, limitations, and recommendations. • Implementation
Roadmap: Next steps for enterprise-wide adoption if POC is successful.
8. Risk & Mitigation
Risk Impact Mitigation
Model accuracy variation Medium Use a hybrid approach (AI + rule-based)
Data complexity High Iterative refinement of preprocessing and extraction
Stakeholder alignment Medium Regular reviews and feedback loops
9. Request
Approval is requested to proceed with this POC to evaluate AI-based summarization capabilities for
unstructured data. A successful POC will form the foundation for scaling this solution across the
organization.
