Subject: Request for Access and Usage Details for LLaMA 2 Model in SmartML

Dear [SmartML Support Team],

I currently have UAT access to the SmartML platform, but I’m unable to locate or try out the LLaMA 2 model. I would like your assistance with the following:
	1.	Access Requirements – Do I need additional permissions or a specific role to access the LLaMA 2 model in the UAT environment?
	2.	Usage Documentation – Are there any user guides, sample notebooks, or API references for interacting with the LLaMA 2 model via SmartML?
	3.	Request Process – If additional approval or access needs to be raised, kindly guide me through the correct process or share the appropriate request form/POC.

This will help me proceed with testing and validating LLaMA 2 for our ongoing PoC activities.
